      "\n",
      "**Key Features:**  \n",
      "1. **Context Awareness:** Uses calendar data, location, and device activity to understand user context (e.g., at work, commuting, home).  \n",
      "2. **Task Prioritization:** Automatically prioritizes tasks based on deadlines, estimated effort, and user-defined goals.  \n",
      "3. **Focus Optimization:** Suggests optimal times for deep work and breaks by analyzing productivity patterns and distractions.  \n",
      "4. **Natural Language Interaction:** Allows users to add, modify, or inquire about tasks through conversational language.  \n",
      "5. **Learning & Adaptation:** Continuously learns from user feedback and outcomes to improve scheduling and suggestions.  \n",
      "6. **Integration:** Syncs seamlessly with calendars, email, task lists, and collaboration tools.  \n",
      "\n",
      "**Potential Technologies:**  \n",
      "- Machine Learning for pattern recognition and personalization  \n",
      "- Natural Language Processing for user interaction  \n",
      "- Reinforcement Learning for dynamic task scheduling  \n",
      "- Mobile and Desktop app integrations  \n",
      "\n",
      "**Use Case Scenario:**  \n",
      "A user starts the day and the agent reviews upcoming deadlines and meetings, then suggests an optimized schedule including focused work blocks. Mid-day, it notices the user is distracted and recommends a short break with a mindfulness exercise. Over time, the agent learns that the user is most productive in late mornings and adjusts scheduling accordingly.\n",
